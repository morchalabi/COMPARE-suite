# COMPARE-suite
COMPARE-suite is a novel ultra-fast software suite (pipeline) to analyze small scale to high-throughput multiparametric screenings in drug discovery and personalized medicine. It
1. consists of several modules for experiment quality control, bias correction, similarity measurement, clustering and visualization,
1. is data-size indpendent,
1. can effectively circumvent batch effect,
1. does not needs dimension reduction,
1. does not need subsampling,
1. is equipped with multithreading mechanism for parallel computing, processing hundreds of samples with numerous markers containing millions of events/cells in a few hours rather than days,
1. can run through graphical user interface on desktop machines or command-line interface on computer servers and
1. can process the output by any plate reader (screening technology) such as mass cytometry and flow cytometry in both text or binary data format.
