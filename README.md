# COMPARE-suite
COMPARE-suite is an ultra-fast software suite (pipeline) to analyze small to large scale multiparametric screening. The suite consists of several modules for experiment quality control, bias correction, similarity measurement, clustering and visualization. Equipped with multithreading for parallel computing, it can process hundreds of samples with numerous markers containing millions of events/cells in a few hours rather than days. It can run through a graphical user interface (GUI) on desktop machines or command-line interface (CLI) on computer clusters. It can process data output by any plate reader or screening technology such as mass cytometry and flow cytometry in both text or binary data format.

The suite can effectively circumvent batch effect in multidimensional screening data with no need for dimension reduction or subsampling. COMPARE-suite is a useful tool for exploring complex multiparametric high throughput screenings like drug-dose responses in drug discovery and personalized medicine.
