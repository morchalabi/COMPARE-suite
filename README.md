# COMPARE-suite
An ultra-fast software suite (pipeline) to analyze small to large scale multiparametric screening. The suite consists of modules for experiment quality control, bias correction, similarity measurement, clustering and visualization. COMPARE-suite can process hundreds of samples with numerous markers containing millions of events/cells in a few hours rather than days. It can run through a graphical user interface (GUI) on desktop machines or command-line interface (CLI) on computer clusters. It can read in both text and binary tabular data such as mass cytometry and flow cytometry data.
